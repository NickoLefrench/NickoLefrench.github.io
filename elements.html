									<h2></h2>
									<p>Through many positions I have had the pleasure to experience, I have aquired many soft skills such as interpersonal communication. I approach every new job as a learning opportunity. Here are some job titles that I've had 
										 over the years.
									Otherwise, please take a closer look at my CV here: <a href="NicholasLefrancois_CV_2025.pdf">NicholasLefrancois_CV</a></p>

										<h2>Bilingual Loan Processing Specialist</h2>
										<p>Although not within the gaming industry, my position at goeasy have developed my analytical and creative problem solving in a professional environment. Since November 2023, I have continued to perform
											with high standards of my quality of work and documentation. I have gained extra responsabilities by helping co-workers throughout the organization in a friendly manner to help future effective communication.
										</p>
									</header>
									<p>Some of the extra responsabilities taken were a part of the Spirit Committee to encourage collaboration and teambuilding. Organizing small outings and potlucks has helped
										bring my diverse work environment to connect.

										<h2>Functionality and Compatibility Tester</h2>
										<p>My first introduction into the world of game development was with Quality Assurance at VMC Volt Tech Montreal during the summer of 2017. 
											This Company was later bought out by Keywords Studios Qc-Tech inc. Where I worked during the summer of 2019. As a tester, I learned values and work discpline
											required to work in office life, meeting quotas and completing checklist of task within a certain timeframe all the while working with a large team.

									<p>As a tester, using JIRA was quintessential to complete tasks. I was able to learn to communicate with developpers while pushing the limits of games.

										<h3>Bartending</h3>
										<p>
										</p>
									</header>
									<p>As a university student, being a bartender had its perks and downfalls. Long hours, loud music and late nights was worth it as it was able to balance with 
										the time I needed during the day for schoolwork. With this job title, I became used to working with a variety of clients as well as sharpening my abilites in french which further developing my communication skills.
										I of course started as a busboy for Chateau-du-Lac in Hudson, but before long I was able to learn the basics of bartending. I took a class with School of Bartending in Montreal, 
										where I honed my skills. Currently, I am working as a bartender at a Dooly's billard bar in Chicoutimi, Saguenay, Quebec.

										<h4>Waiter</h4>
										<p></p>
									</header>
									<p>Before gaining the oppotunity to be a bartender, I was first a waiter at multiple restaurants. I was learned what a fast paced work environment was like, how to communicate well with clients and improvise solutions to help out upset clientel.
										I had the opportunity to be a server at Napolitain 500 and Mckibbins pub in Vaudreuil-Dorion as well as Cameron's Pub and Wendigo in Hudson, Quebec.

										<h5>Cashier</h5>
										<p></p>
									</header>
									<p>When I was younger and started my journey and participation in the economy, I worked many part-time cashier jobs. It helped build character and support me through academia. With this job title, I learned for the first time how to communicate with clientel and help them with their needs</p>
