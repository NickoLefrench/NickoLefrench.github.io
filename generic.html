									<h1>My Academic Background</h1>
									<p>After getting my DEC from John Abbott College, I realized that I wanted to work in the gaming industry. I took some programming courses, 
										but discovered that I am much more interested in the artistic and design side of game production. So I started taking classes in 3D Modeling and Game Design 
										at Lasalle College and got my AEC. I learned how to use Photoshop, 3Ds Max, ZBrush and Substance Painter along side what goes into the production process and design of a game. 
										I am always striving to be better at what I do so I can give back what the gaming community gave to me.<br />
									<br />
									To continue to build upon my knowledge, I went and got a Bachelors majoring in Video game Programming with a minor in History at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. 
									There I learned in-depth how to program with Java, C# in Unity and C++ with Unreal 4. With Unreal 5 just released, I'm excited to continue to learn and expand my abilities.</p>

								<p>I've always been interested in the intricacies of game design. What makes a game compelling to me is how gameplay as well as level design guides players into 
									creating compelling personal stories. Games that are released with level editors are what introduced me to world of level and game design. Games such as Farcry and Arma 3 
									allowed me to create scenarios and test them with friends. Which each iteration and idea helping me further my skills and understanding of what makes a game and level fun to play.
									Dungeons and Dragons has been a huge influence for my passion in game design. Allowing players to be creative duiring encounters and story beats is what brings me joy playing the game.
